    ## Dataset: Bank Marketing

    We use a bank marketing dataset where the goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe
    to a term deposit (`y = 1`) or not (`y = 0`).

    **Source**: This dataset is based on direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank.

    **Class imbalance**: The target variable is imbalanced (~88% no, ~12% yes), which is common
    in real-world classification problems.

    ## Feature Selection

    For this demonstration, we select a subset of 7 features:

    **Numeric features** (4):
    - `age`: Client's age
    - `balance`: Average yearly balance in euros
    - `duration`: Last contact duration in seconds (highly predictive but only known after call)
    - `campaign`: Number of contacts during this campaign

    **Categorical features** (3):
    - `marital`: Marital status (married, single, divorced)
    - `education`: Education level (primary, secondary, tertiary, unknown)
    - `housing`: Has housing loan? (yes, no)

    We sample 10,000 rows for faster demonstration.
